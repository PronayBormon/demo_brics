                                            Members of the BRICS have decided to establish an “AI study group” to create and oversee AI governance frameworks.
    
                                            The BRICS countries intend to establish an “AI study group” to track the growth and development of the technology, according to proposals outlined by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The proposal was under discussion on the second day of the BRICS meeting which took place in Johannesburg, South Africa.
                                            
                                            In an effort to make the technologies more secure, dependable, controllable, and equal, Jinping stated that “we need to develop AI governance frameworks.” China pledged to establish a China-BRICS science and innovation incubation park to speed up cooperation among member nations in the area of artificial intelligence, adding that the group’s creation timeline would be announced in due course.
