                        <h6>What Is BRICS?</h6>
                        <p>The term BRICS is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The coin was initially created as BRIC (without South Africa) by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill in 2001, claiming that by 2050 the four BRIC economies would come to dominate the global economy. South Africa was added to the list in 2010. The BRICS countries operate as a loose organization that seeks to further economic cooperation amongst member nations and increase their economic and political standing in the world.</p>
                        
                        <h6>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h6>
                        <p>BRICS is an acronym that refers to Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
                        Goldman Sachs created the term BRIC in 2001 for Brazil, Russia, India, and China under the belief that these economies would dominate global growth by 2050.
                        The BRICS nations offered a source of foreign expansion for firms and strong returns for institutional investors.
                        The organization seeks to deepen economic cooperation between the member countries and stand in contrast to the Western sphere of power.
                        Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Argentina were invited to join BRICS in 2023.

                        <h6>Understanding BRICS</h6>
                        <p>Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa ranked among the world's fastest-growing emerging market economies for years, thanks to low labor costs, favorable demographics, and abundant natural resources at a time of a global commodities boom.</p>
                        
                        <p>The group has a set of joint priorities, which include:</p>
                        
                        <p>Working on resolving regional problems, such as the Iranian nuclear program and conflicts in Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan
                        Tackling financial and economic issues like reforms at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)
                        Establishing the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism</p>
                        
                        <p>he Goldman Sachs thesis didn't suggest that these countries would become a political alliance like the European Union (EU) or even a formal trading association. Instead, the investment banking firm said these countries have the potential to form a powerful economic bloc, even acknowledging that its forecasts were optimistic and dependent on significant policy assumptions.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Still, the implication was that economic power would bring political power, and indeed leaders from BRICS countries regularly attended summits together and often acted in concert with each others’ interests.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>According to BRICS, the GDP of their nations accounts for 31.5% of global GDP, compared to 30.7% of the G7 nations.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h6>History of BRICS</h6>
                        <p>BRICS sees itself as a counter to the traditional Western-led global order, with many member states seeing the organization as a way to boost their influence around the world. Still, many of the nations disagree on fundamental factors, such as transparency and a balanced approach, which may hinder the growth of the group.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The group operates as an informal grouping of nations that meet annually at the BRICS convention, where members and heads of state seek to further economic cooperation between the nations. The head of state of a member nation acts as the chairman of the group, rotating once a year. Informal meetings began in 2006 but the group's first official meeting was on June 16, 2009, in Yekaterinburg, Russia.</p>

                        <p>Because of the economic power of the nations, as well as the idea of disentangling from the West to a degree, BRICS claims that over 40 countries seek to join the group. The BRICs announced that it invited additional countries to join the group at its 2023 summit. Full membership will be granted to Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates on Jan. 1, 2024.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Some of the other key developments of the group include:</p>
                        
                        <p>The development of the New Development Bank. The institution was established in 2015 to provide emerging markets and developing countries with funding for infrastructure and sustainable development projects</p>.
                        
                        <p>Establishing the BRICS Parliamentary Forum, which is designed to "strengthen and promote contacts at the leadership level of chambers, committees and groups of parliamentarians." This body is responsible for inter-parliamentary exchanges and consultations along with the development of new mechanisms for inter-parliamentary cooperation.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The BRICS thesis became conventional market wisdom in the aughts. But there were always skeptics, including some who claimed the phrase was Goldman marketing hype for its BRICS-focused investment fund.</p>

                        Goldman Sachs' BRIC Thesis
                        <p>In 2001, Goldman Sach's O’Neill noted that while global gross domestic product (GDP) was set to rise 1.7% in 2002, BRIC nations were forecasted to grow more quickly than the Group of Seven (G7), which are the world's seven most advanced global economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. In the paper "Building Better Economic BRICs," O'Neill outlined his view of the potential of the BRIC nations.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>  In 2003, O'Neill's Goldman colleagues Dominic Wilson and Roopa Purushothaman followed up with their report "Dreaming with BRICs: The Path to 2050.” The two authors claimed that by 2050, the BRIC cluster could grow to a size larger than the G6 (the G7 minus Russia), and the world’s largest economies would therefore look drastically different in four decades. That is, the largest global economic powers no longer would be the richest, according to income per capita.</p>
                            
                        <p>In 2007, Goldman published another report, "BRICs and Beyond," that focused on BRIC's growth potential, the environmental impact of these growing economies, and the sustainability of their rise. The report also outlined a Next 11, a term for 11 emerging economies, in relationship to the BRIC nations, as well as the ascendancy of new global markets.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h6>Closure of Goldman's BRICS Fund</h6>
                        <p>Growth in the BRICS economies slowed down after the global financial crisis and the oil price collapse that began in 2014. By 2015, the BRICS acronym no longer looked like an attractive investment venue, and funds aimed at these economies either shut down or merged with other investment vehicles.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Goldman Sachs merged its BRICS investment fund, which was focused on generating returns from these economies, with the broader Emerging Markets Equity Fund. The fund lost 88% of its assets from a 2010 peak.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Goldman Sachs stated that it did not expect "significant asset growth in the foreseeable future" in the BRICS fund. Per a Bloomberg report, the fund lost 21% in five years.</p>
                        
                        <p>What Countries Are in BRICS?
                            The BRICS nations are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In 2023, the group invited Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates to join. Full membership is expected to be granted as of Jan. 1, 2024.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h6>Why Was BRICS Created?</h6>
                        <p>BRICS was created by Goldman Sachs as an analytical grouping of emerging market countries that witnessed strong economic growth and were poised to dominate the world economy by 2050. These countries now operate as a loose organization, seeking to further economic ties with each other.</p>
                        
                        <h6>What Is the Main Goal of BRICS?</h6>
                        <p>The main goals of BRICS are cooperation, development, and influence in international affairs. Goals include economic cooperation, development financing, political coordination, social and cultural exchanges, technology and innovation, sustainable development, and peace and security.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h6>The Bottom Line</h6>
                        <p>BRICS is an informal grouping of emerging market countries that seek to establish deeper ties between their nations and cooperate on economic expansion, including trade. The countries act as a balance against traditional Western influence, seeking to depend on each other for growing influence in the world.</p>
